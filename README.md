 Question to be answered
 
Frequency Of Accidents:
  - What is the total number of accidents recorded in the dataset?
  - How are accidents distributed over different years, months, days of the week, and hours of the day?
  - Are there observable trends or patterns in accident occurrences over time?

Geographical Distribution
  - Which locations (e.g., cities, intersections, road segments) have the highest frequency of accidents?
  - How are accidents distributed across various regions or zones?
  - Are there specific hotspots with a notably high incidence of accidents?

Accident Severity Analysis: 
  - What is the distribution of accident severities (e.g., fatal, serious, minor)?
  - What percentage of accidents resulted in fatalities or serious injuries?
  - Is there a correlation between accident severity and other factors like time of day or location?

 Demographic Insights: 
   -  What are the age and gender distributions of individuals involved in accidents?
   -  Which age groups exhibit higher involvement in accidents?
   -  Is there a significant difference in accident involvement between genders?

Environmental and Road Conditions: 
  - How do weather conditions correlate with accident occurrences?
  - What is the distribution of accidents across different road types (e.g., highways, urban roads)?
  - How do lighting conditions (e.g., daylight, dusk, night) impact accident frequencies? 

Vehicle and Driver Information: 
  - What types of vehicles are most frequently involved in accidents?
  - Is there a relationship between vehicle type and accident severity?
  - How does driver experience or behavior (e.g., speeding, seatbelt usage) relate to accident occurrences? 

Temporal Patterns:
  - Are there peak times during the day or specific days of the week when accidents are more prevalent?
  - How do accident frequencies vary between weekdays and weekends?
  - Is there a seasonal variation in accident occurrences?

Contributing Factors:
  - What are the most common contributing factors to accidents (e.g., distracted driving, alcohol impairment)?
  - How do these factors vary across different accident severities?
  - Are certain factors more prevalent in specific locations or times?

Injury and Fatality Analysis:
  -  What is the distribution of injuries and fatalities among different road users (e.g.,drivers, passengers, pedestrians)?
  -  How do injury severities correlate with factors like vehicle type or speed?
  -  Are there specific scenarios that lead to higher fatality rates?

Comparative Analysis
  - How do accident statistics compare between different regions or time periods?
  - Are there significant differences in accident characteristics between urban and rural areas?
  - How do the findings align with external data sources or national statistics?
